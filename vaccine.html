          There are many different types of vaccines for COVID-19, released by various governments and pharmaceutical companies, and split 
          among multiple delivery methods. Some vaccines are mRNA based, and as such are a new type of vaccine that encourages peoples'
          cells to produce more immune cells that specifically attack the COVID virus. Others are the more common carrier vaccines, where 
          patients are injected with a harmless variation of COVID to prepare the body to fight off the more lethal version later.
          These different vaccines all have their advantages and disadvantages, and may need one or several applications and booster shots
          to be fully effective.

            Walk-in appointments are also accepted at New York State mass vaccination sites for all eligible adults. These mass vaccination sites are determined by the government,
